# Welcome to My Blog

This is a sample blog post to test that the blog route is working correctly. The blog system supports MDX content with frontmatter metadata.

## Features

- **MDX Support**: Write posts in Markdown with JSX components
- **Frontmatter**: Structured metadata for each post
- **Categories**: Organize posts by topic
- **Tags**: Flexible tagging system
- **Featured Posts**: Highlight important content

## Code Example

```typescript
const greeting = "Hello, Blog!";
console.log(greeting);
```

This should render properly with syntax highlighting and all the blog features working as expected.

Happy blogging! ðŸš€
